# multi_lang

This repository contains code for a multi-language translation project. It includes scripts to translate YouTube video transcripts into different target languages using the YouTube Transcript API and the Google Cloud Translation API. The translated transcripts are then summarized using a language model.

## Setting up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code with the [Remote - Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) installed.
3. The development container is defined in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. It specifies the container image to use and the features to install. The container is based on the universal dev container from Microsoft, and it includes the following features:
    - Google Cloud CLI (image: `ghcr.io/dhoeric/features/google-cloud-cli:1`)
    - Python (image: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1`)
    - Docker-in-Docker (image: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2`)

## translate-python

The `translate-python` directory contains code for translating YouTube video transcripts and summarizing the translated texts.

### Dockerfile

The `dockerfile` in the `translate-python` directory sets up the Python environment for running the translation and summary scripts. It uses the official Python 3.8 runtime as the base image and installs the required packages specified in `requirements.txt`. It also exposes port 80 for the Streamlit web application.

### get_transcript.py

The `get_transcript.py` script contains functions for fetching YouTube video transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API. It includes a function to extract the video ID from a YouTube URL and retrieve the transcript data for that video. It also provides a function to combine all text segments into a single string.

### requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages required to run the translation and summary scripts. Install these packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### streamlit_app.py

The `streamlit_app.py` script sets up a web application using Streamlit. It provides a function to summarize a YouTube video transcript using the `get_transcript.py` script. The summarized text is generated by randomly selecting sentences from the transcript and passing them to the `summarize.py` script. The resulting summary is printed to the console.

### summarize.py

The `summarize.py` script contains functions for summarizing text using the Google Cloud AI Platform. It uses a language model to generate a summary of the input text. The script makes use of environment variables for authentication and uses the `dotenv` package to load the necessary credentials. It also downloads the NLTK data if it is not already available.

## Usage

To use the translation and summary scripts, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r translate-python/requirements.txt`.
2. Update the API credentials in the `.env` file with your own Google Cloud credentials.
3. Run the `streamlit_app.py` script to start the Streamlit web application.

Please note that the accuracy of the translation and summary may vary depending on the input text and language model used.
