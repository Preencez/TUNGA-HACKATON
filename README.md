## Introduction

This repository contains a GitHub README Generator, which is a Python script that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate professional README files for GitHub repositories. The generated README files are clear, concise, and well-formatted.

## Installation

To use the GitHub README Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

   ```
   GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_access_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage

To generate a README file for a GitHub repository, run the `app.py` script with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the GitHub repository URL, your GitHub access token, and your OpenAI API key. Once you provide the required information, click the "Generate README" button to generate the README content.

The generated README content will be displayed in a text area. Copy the content and paste it into your repository's README file.

- Automatically generates a README file for a GitHub repository.
- Uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language generation.
